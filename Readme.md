🚕 Taxi Service API – Final University Project

This is a complete backend API for an online taxi service platform, implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL.
It supports user registration (drivers), vehicle management, model assignment, and trip creation between passengers and drivers.

The project follows a clean architecture with:
✔ Controllers
✔ DTOs
✔ Services
✔ Repositories
✔ EF Core migrations
✔ PostgreSQL database
✔ Swagger documentation

📌 Project Features

Vehicle ↔ Model (1:1 relationship)

Driver ↔ Vehicle (1:N relationship)

Passenger → Trip (1:N relationship)

Driver → Trip (1:N relationship)

Secure access ready (OAuth2/JWT ready)

Swagger UI enabled

Railway deployment ready

📜 Swagger

Available at:

Local
https://localhost:{port}/swagger

Railway
https://{your-app}.up.railway.app/swagger


Provides:

Interactive API testing

Schema definitions

Validation rules

1️⃣ Configure PostgreSQL

Create database:

CREATE DATABASE taxiapp;

2️⃣ Configure connection string

appsettings.Development.json:

"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=yourpass;Database=taxiapp"
}

3️⃣ Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update

4️⃣ Run the API
dotnet run

🚀 Deployment (Railway)
1. Create a PostgreSQL service

Railway gives you:

PGHOST=
PGPORT=
PGDATABASE=
PGUSER=
PGPASSWORD=

2. Deploy the API from GitHub

“New → Deploy from Repo → Your Repository”

3. Add environment variables
Key	Value
ConnectionStrings__Default	Host=${PGHOST};Port=${PGPORT};Database=${PGDATABASE};Username=${PGUSER};Password=${PGPASSWORD};SslMode=Require;TrustServerCertificate=True
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT	Production
4. Open the API
https://{yourapp}.up.railway.app
